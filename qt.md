# QT desktop app

Make a GUI frontend for [rclone](https://rclone.org/) using the [Qt6](https://www.qt.io/development/qt-framework/qt6) framework.

## Requirements

1. Use an open-source license (obviously :) )
2. App must support basic operations such as -
    - adding, removing, and editing remotes
    - file manager view for managing files
    - view associated metadata of each file
3. Additionally, try implementing the following features -
    - setting up cronjobs for periodic background sync operations
    - support for mounting and unmounting files
    - modifying rclone params

We prefer if you write your code in C++, but Python is also acceptable
